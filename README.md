# JARVIS - an artificial neural network framework in java  

## Features:  
  1. Support for dense/fully connected, batch normallization, dropout, Pooling layers(Average/Max) and convolutional layers.
  2. Support for supervised learning (SGD - stochastic gradient descent) and the genetic algorithm.
  3. Support for multiple activation functions Support for multiple loss functions.

## Code example
A simple nerual network to preform the xor operation

## Roadmap:  
  1. Pooling layers(Average/Max) - done!.
  2. Reinforcement learning.
  3. Resnet blocks. 
  4. Support for RNN - Recurring neural network. 

## Possiable minor updates:  
  1. Revamp the genetic algorithm Add more activation / loss functions.
