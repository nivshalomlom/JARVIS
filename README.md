# JARVIS
JARVIS - a artificial neural network framework in java  
Feauters:  
  1. Support for dense/fully connected, batch normallization, dropout, Pooling layers(Average/Max) and convolutional layers
  2. Support for supervised learning (SGD - stochastic gradient descent) and the genetic algorithem 
  3. Support for multiple activation functions Support for multiple loss functions 

Roadmap:  
  1. Pooling layers(Average/Max) - done! 
  2. Reinforcement learning Resnet blocks 
  3. Support for RNN - Recurring neural network 

Possiable minor updates:  
  1. Revamp the genetic algorithm Add more activation / loss functions
